# StoryMill Development Standards
## Code Quality Standards
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features (async/await, destructuring, arrow functions)
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)

## API Integration Guidelines
- Always implement rate limiting and retry logic for external APIs
- Store API keys in environment variables, never hardcode
- Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Add proper loading states and error messages for users

## Performance Requirements
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading and compression
- Implement audio streaming for large files
- Use Web Workers for heavy processing tasks
- Cache generated content locally when possible

## Security Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file uploads
- Implement CORS properly
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Never expose sensitive data in client-side code

## Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for core functions
- Test API integrations with mock data
- Validate audio/video output quality
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Performance testing for large stories
